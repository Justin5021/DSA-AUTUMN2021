# DSA-AUTUMN2021

**Subject:** 31251 Data Structures and Algorithms

**Grade:** High Distinction

## Assignment 1 - Weighted Undirected Graph
Implement a set of functionalities such as:
- Depth-First Search
- Breadth-First Search
- Minimum Spanning Tree
- Other necessary functionalities

All of which should be completed in the `graph.hpp` file provided to us.

**Idea**: Map of Maps to represent an adjacency list. A pair in the adjacency list is an edge represented by the maps i.e. `adj_list[A][B]` returns an equivalent weight to `adj_list[B][A]`.

## Assignment 2 - Binary Search Tree
Implement:
- Preorder, Inorder and Postorder Traversals
- Breadth-First Search
- Node Pathway
- Heaviest Path
- Other necessary functionalities
